Nick can you put you rresults file undernath a subfolder with your name. e.g . reults/nlamers/...





- in general a readme for internal use should be created to document where things are in development
- reorganizing auxiliary scripts, functions, and utility functions folders
  - perhaps have a functions folder, then organize functions intor subfolders.
    - e.g. functions/build/build01 & functions/build/build02 (though we might want to not name build scripts numerically)
- renaming build files so they more accurately refere what it done




- walk through asses_vae script
  - why is embryo_df saved underneath a directory called figures?
